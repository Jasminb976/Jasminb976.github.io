      <p>The original project reminded greatly of a to-do list that you would find in your notes.
        Unfortunately, I wasn't able to execute it terms of ideas. So instead, I decided to based it on a grocery list that 
        I had on my phone and I added extra opinions or phrases that connected to the ingredient. I had a difficult time in executing the code at first
        because it would stop by the third ingredient, so I had to refer to the original code multiple times.
