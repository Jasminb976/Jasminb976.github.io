          <h2>Choose one of the assigned articles. What is interesting to you in this article/work and why?</h2>
          <p>I chose the <a href = "https://products.minguhongmfg.com/fruitful-presentation/#23" target = "_blank">Fruitful Presentation</a> by Min Guhong. 
            I found it interesting how simple this website is, but it's effective in conveying its messages. I also like how the website alternates
            the color scheme every few pages so that the user doesn't lose interest in the website. I also love how the green and yellow color allows the 
            user to read the text regardless of what color the background is and what color the font is.

          <h2>Do you agree with the author, why?</h2>
          <p>For the most part, the website talks about the creator talks about their favorite HTML tags and CSS, but there is a stament that stuck to me.
            Technology has always been something that you can access easily, especially around these times. AI is a very good example of how a tool can be used 
            in either a good or bad way. There's websites that allow you to submit slideshows from a class and it gives you flashcards or a simplified set of notes.
            However, people take advantage of AI and ultimately grow dependent on it.

          <h2>What other media (writings, images, etc.) this article reminds you of, and how are they related?</h2>
          <p>This article reminds me of the 1985 Mushroom painting from Yayoi Kusama due to the brightful colors that contrast with one another.</p>
